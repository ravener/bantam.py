# bantam.py
This a port of [Bantam](https://github.com/munificent/bantam) to Python, which demonstrates Pratt parsing as part of [this blog post](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2011/03/19/pratt-parsers-expression-parsing-made-easy/)

The code was written to mimic the original Java code as close as possible.

I've written everything in a single file to keep it simple, even though it ended up being over 500+ lines of code I think the concept should still be clear and you don't have to jump between files.

## Usage
Simply grab the code and run it with:
```sh
$ python main.py
```
There are no external dependencies.
